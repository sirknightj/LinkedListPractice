# LinkedListPractice

This lets you practice re-arranging Linked List Nodes.

Set up a scenario with two initial Nodes p and q. Then, set up the final state that they should end up in.

Afterwards, write some code to re-arrange the Nodes by chainging their links. You should not change the integer fields of the Node objects.

This will let you know whether or not you've done it right or not.
